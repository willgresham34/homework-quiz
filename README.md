# homework-quiz

This page was created as a homework project for our unit on WebApi's.

In this homework I continued to learn alot about functions and how they work and what ways they can be used.

The quiz is 4 questions about basic coding fundamentals and scores you based of the time you have left when you finish the quiz.

It also contains a higghscore page in which you can put your initials in along with your score and will keep track of other players scores based off of local storage.
